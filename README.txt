DESCRIPTION:
This project is an interactive quiz developed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, leveraging the Open Trivia Database API to generate dynamic questions based on category selection and a progressive difficulty system. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to focus on the game. The scoring system rewards the speed and accuracy of responses, with the addition of a skip button that helps maintain the active multiplier. There could still be many improvements and additions in certain areas. However, I will not be following a roadmap to focus on other projects. This was perfect for exploring API integration in front-end web applications.
